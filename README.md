# Titanic 

The purpose of this project is to try to implement a machine learning algrothim (Logistic Regression) from scratch and see how accuracte I can get without the benefit of any ML packages. Going to try this only using Pandas, Numpy, and MatPlotLib... for "fun"

Going to stick to the basics with this since it's my first ML project all on my own. 
* define function necessary for logistic regression
* use these functions on some very basic numeric columns
* use learning curves to make sure everything is working
* do some feature engineering
* tune the parameters
* see what the accuracy is

The data for this project was retreived from Kaggle.com
