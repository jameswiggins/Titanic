# Titanic 

The purpose of this project is to try to implement a machine learning algrothim (Logistic Regression) from scratch and see how accuracte I can get without the benefit of any ML packages. Going to try this using only Pandas, Numpy, and MatPlotLib.

Game plan
* Define functions necessary for logistic regression
* Use these functions on some very basic numeric columns
* Use learning curves to make sure everything is working
* Do some feature engineering
* Tune the parameters
* See what the accuracy is
